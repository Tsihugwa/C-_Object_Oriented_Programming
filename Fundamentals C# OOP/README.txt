Task
Developing a small prototype system for determining whether students at this university have passed their course or not. 

As part of this system the university administrators need to be able to: 
Enter the student name
Enter the student number
This is in the format of a 9 digit number 
Enter the module marks for each student
Each student undertakes 6 modules per course 
Students are awarded a mark between 1-100 
Calculate the average grade 
Determine from the average grade whether the student has passed the course 
Pass mark is an average grade of 40 or higher 
Present a summary of the student, including ID details, individual module marks and overall course result


WeAreCars would like this system to be as robust and as user friendly as possible. Attention to detail and the inclusion of validation and help systems / tooltips are recommended.

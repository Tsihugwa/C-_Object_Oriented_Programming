Task
Developing a Windows forms based application using C# that will assist in the rental of cars. The systems must be able to do and include the following:

A welcome splash screen
A staff login page that allows a staff member to login into the system, using a fixed username and password
Username : sta001
Password: givemethekeys123
An area that displays a list of the current bookings / rentals
A main booking area that will process the booking. This area will allow a staff member to enter and/or  select certain options (Mandatory fields are denoted with a *):
Customer First Name*

Valid driving license*
If no, the booking can’t proceed
Number of days* (£25 per day)
